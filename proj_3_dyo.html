		<p> Oslo, formerly (1624–1877) Christiania or (1877–1925) Kristiania, capital and largest city of Norway. It lies at the head of Oslo Fjord in the southeastern part of the country. The original site of Oslo was east of the Aker River. The city was founded by King Harald Hardraade about 1050, and about 1300 the Akershus fortress was built by Haakon V. After the city was destroyed by fire in 1624, Christian IV of Denmark-Norway built a new town farther west, under the walls of the Akershus fortress, and called it Christiania. The growth of Christiania’s population in the 19th century was due in part to the absorption of surrounding municipalities, and the city replaced its rival, the west-coast port of Bergen, as Norway’s largest and most influential city.

		<p>Viking Ship Museum: An arm of the University of Oslo’s Cultural History Museum, the Viking Ship Museum has jaw-dropping finds from four different Viking burial sites around the Oslo Fjord.The museum is on the Bygdøy Peninsula and shines thanks to the Oseberg Ship. This 9th-century burial ship was excavated in 1904-05 and is like new as it had been encased for all that time in watertight and airtight mud. No less exciting are similar ships from Tune and Gokstad, together with all the artefacts found buried with them like beds, small boats, a complete cart, tent components, wood carvings, textiles and other treasures brought to light in Viking graves. As you go, the film Vikings Alive is projected onto the walls and ceiling, adding context on Viking burial rituals.

		<p>Vigeland Museum: After the sculpture park visit the Vigeland Museum in the Neoclassical building on the southern boundary. This beautiful structure was built in the 1920s as the atelier and home of Gustav Vigeland after he had agreed to donate his works to the city. After his death the building became a museum in 1947, preserving his private apartment on the third floor where he lived from 1924 to 1943 and which is fitted for the most part with items he designed. And being the place where Vigeland worked, the museum gives you a clear sense of the artists’ process, revealing the plaster models for the sculptures in the park, preparatory sketches, casts as well as many of Vigeland’s earlier pieces. There are also short-term contemporary art exhibitions at the museum.

		<p> Oslo  OZ-loh, US also  OSS-loh,Norwegian:(audio speaker iconlisten) or is the capital and most populous city of Norway. It constitutes both a county and a municipality. The municipality of Oslo had a population of 698,660 in 2021, while the city's greater urban area had a population of 1,019,513 in 2019, and the metropolitan area had an estimated population of 1.71 million in 2010. During the Viking Age the area was part of Viken. Oslo was founded as a city at the end of the Viking Age in 1040 under the name Ánslo, and established as a kaupstad or trading place in 1048 by Harald Hardrada. The city was elevated to a bishopric in 1070 and a capital under Haakon V of Norway around 1300. Personal unions with Denmark from 1397 to 1523 and again from 1536 to 1814 reduced its influence. After being destroyed by a fire in 1624, during the reign of King Christian IV, a new city was built closer to Akershus Fortress and named Christiania in honour of the king. It became a municipality (formannskapsdistrikt) on 1 January 1838. The city functioned as the capital of Norway during the 1814–1905 union between Sweden and Norway. From 1877, the city's name was spelled Kristiania in government usage, a spelling that was adopted by the municipal authorities in 1897. In 1925, the city, after incorporating the village retaining its former name, was renamed Oslo. In 1948 Oslo merged with Aker, a municipality which surrounded the capital and which was 27 times larger, thus creating the modern, much larger Oslo municipality.
